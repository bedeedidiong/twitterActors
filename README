TwitterActors
=============

A fork of Scala (originally, 2.7.7) actor library that partially relies on 
java.util.concurrent.* classes to avoid some problems with Scala's built-in
copy of various concurrent classes. Notably, it is using BlockingQueue, 
LinkedBlockingQueue, and TimeUnit from java.util.concurrent package instead of
their private copies.

In order to use this library instead of Scala actor library, import 
com.twitter.actors.* instead of scala.actors.*.
